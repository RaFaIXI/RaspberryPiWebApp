WebApp to see in real time mmy raspberry pi 4 server status (usefull for my other projects)

Objective for hackers :
Display fake values such as:
Temperature: 999°C
Call ID: "hacked"
Hint : Inspecting the page won’t work, you have to hack the requests
For help or If you succeed, send a screenshot to discord : rafaixi for €200

Potential upgrade: implement a handshake mechanism for time synchronization between clients and the server. Currently, requests are only accepted if the response time is within a maximum of X seconds; otherwise, the signature is rejected.
